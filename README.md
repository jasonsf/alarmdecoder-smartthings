This repository provides support for the AlarmDecoder webapp inside of the SmartThings or Hubitat home automation platforms.

## Requirements

* AlarmDecoder webapp 0.8.3+
* SmartThings or Hubitat hub

## Features

* Arm, disarm, toggle chime, or panic your alarm system from within SmartThings/Hubitat.
* Provides virtual sensors that can be tied to zones on your panel to allow automation based on zones faulting and restoring.
* Provides virtual momentary switches with indicators for arming away, stay and toggling chime mode with each switch indicating the current state. Alexa<sup>[\#warn](#warn)</sup> and other systems are able to activate these switches to allow a wide array of alarm panel control possibilities.
* Provide virtual contact sensors for "Ready" and "Alarm Bell" indications on the alarm panel.
* Provides a virtual "Smoke Alarm" that can be integrated with SHM or other systems to control state during a fire event such as turning all lights on.
* Provides the ability to create virtual switches that can be tied to specific Contact ID report codes from the alarm panel. As an example a zone setup as a Carbon Monoxide alarm can be directly tied to a virtual switch that will OPEN in the event it triggers using Contact ID 162.
* Provides the ability to create virtual switches that can be tied to specific 5800 RF devices. Typical use case is using a 5800micra sensor to monitor open/close of secure areas but not require panel zone programming to use. Just record its serial number and tie it to a virtual device using the serial number only.
* Smart Home Monitor / Home Security Module integration.  
One-way - Arm or disarm your panel when the Smart Home Monitor status is changed.  
Two-way - Change Smart Home Monitor's status when your panel is armed or disarmed.  
* Change virtual device handlers in the graph pages to change device capabilities and the system will adjust event types to match the device. Change a Zone Sensor to a Virtual Smoke Alarm and it will report 'clear' or 'detected'. This allows changing of device types to match what is needed for the task.  

<a name="warn">#warn</a>: Alexa and other systems may be confused by the device name to send ON or OFF action too. This can be done using fuzzy AI logic than can cause the system to send the event to a Panic or Alarm action button triggering an alarm. Thoughtful naming of devices as well as restricting access is advised before allowing these external systems to access the virtual buttons.</sup>

<a name="vdevicenames">#1</a>: The device name prefix is configurable during install by changing @Field lname at the top of the ***AlarmDecoder Service*** code. The name can be changed after installing but the address must not be modified.  

<a name="cidmask">#2</a>: ***AAA*** is the Contact ID number ***B*** is the partition and ***CCC*** is the zone or user code to match with '???' matching all. Ex. CID-401-012 will monitor user 012 arming/disarming. Supports regex in the deviceNetworkId to allow to create devices that can trigger on multiple CID messages such as ***"CID-4[0,4]]1-1-???"*** will monitor all users for arming/disarming away or stay on partition 1.  

<a name="rfxmask">#3</a>:AAAAAA is the RF Serial Number B is battery status, C is supervisor event(ignore with ?), D is loop0(ignore with ?), E is loop1(ignore with ?), F is loop2(ignore with ?) and E is loop3(ignore with ?). Ex. RFX-123456-?-?-1-?-?-? will monitor 5800 RF sensor with serial number 123456 and loop1 for changes.  

<a name="zonenumbers">#4</a>: The number assigned initially to each device zone name is sequential and arbitrary. The actual zone tracked for each device is configured in the **AlarmDecoder UI** device settings page.  So 'Security Zone Sensor #1' could actually be zone 20.  Rename these as needed.

<a name="flexible_handlers">#5</a>: Each AlarmDecoder Virtual device receives a default type when it is created. This Device Type or Device Handler can be changed using the device editor. [Several example device types](#devicetypes) are provided and more can be created using the examples as reference.  

<a name="devicetypes"></a>
## Alarm Decoder Device Handlers  
The Device Type or Device Handler for a given virtual device can be changed at any time. If the application requires a Smoke Detector and does not support Contact Sensors simply change the Type in the device editor. AlarmDecoder virtual devices will receive a translated message from on/off to a message appropriate to the devices type and capabilities.

### Configure Contact ID switches
**CID** or **Contact ID** is a prevalent and respected format for communications between alarms and the systems at alarm monitoring agencies that they report to.

If the Ademco panel has an existing Internet or cellular communicator then the AD2 is able to capture these messages and PUSH them to the home automation system as virtual switches. For DSC Power Series panels this feature is a Zero configuration feature(it just works). With Ademco panels a communicator is required or you can enable LRR messaging in your panel programming and enable LRR Emulation on the AlarmDecoder. In both panels it may be necessary to Enable / Disable reporting for some types of events.

1. Open up the SmartThings app **on your phone**
2. Tap **My Home** and select the **Things** tab
3. Select the **AlarmDecoder(AD2)** device
